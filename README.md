### Decision Support System for Ranking of Software Reliability Growth Models
#### This is the implementation for the Decision Support System we (myself, [Hitesh](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=OE1IYIoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra), [Dr. Vijay Kumar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=-ZCoEd0AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Hoang Pham](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=PJXcWGAAAAAJ&hl=en)) proposed in the paper https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-21232-1_12.

> In this chapter, we have studied the mentioned problem and the solution to automate it with the developed compact Decision Support System (DSS), which includes all the functionalities and computational analysis of error logs and ensure error-free software to achieve the desired objective. The DSS is developed in Python utilizing several well-known packages such as Numpy, Scipy, Tkinter, and Pandas.
